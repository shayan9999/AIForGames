		<H3>Snails! - rules of the game.</H3>
		<p><strong>1.</strong> The object of the game is to occupy (leave your Slime in) 
			more of the GridSquares than all of your opponents when the game ends.</p>
		<p><strong>2.</strong> Players take turns to move. A player turn consists of moving 
			a Snail horizontally or vertically to an adjacent empty square.</p>
		<p><strong>3.</strong> Moving into an empty GridSquare leaves your previously 
			occupied GridSquare with a trail of your slime. SPLAT!</p>
		<p><strong>4.</strong> Not only can you move into empty squares, but you can move 
			back onto your own Trail of Slime. This has a disadvantage, however; your Slime 
			is slippy, and any move back onto your Slime will send you sliding to the 
			furthest point on that Trail in the direction you moved (fig. 1). This may be 
			useful for getting some missed GridSquares, or ones that were previously 
			unavailable.</p>
		<IMG src="GridWorldHelp02.bmp">
		<p><strong>5.</strong> You can not, however, move onto your opponent's Trail of 
			Slime. As the colours suggest your opponent's Trails are toxic, making them 
			impassable. Your opponent, also cannot move into a GridSquare occupied by your 
			Trail. Use this to your advantage!!</p>
		<p><strong>6.</strong> If you make 10 moves in a row without capturing a new empty 
			GridSquare, (i.e. just keep sliding around on your slime for 10 moves) then 
			your game ends, but your opponent can still move, until his/her 10 moves are 
			up.</p>
		<p><strong>7.</strong> When both players have finished moving, or cannot capture 
			any more GridSquares, the game is over and the player with the highest score 
			(most GridSquares captured) is the winner.</p>
		<H3>File Menu - Playing and Replaying a game.</H3>
		The file menu can be used to load or save a game as either a .terrain file or a 
		.replay file. A .terrain file is simply a&nbsp;board position. A .replay file 
		contains the initial board position and all moves played so far.
		<h4>Play and Replay mode</h4>
		<P>When a terrain file is loaded the user is said to be in 'Play mode' and when a 
			replay file is loaded the user is said to be in 'Replay mode'. If a user is in 
			Replay mode he can choose to swap over to 'Play mode' starting from the current 
			position (and discarding all turn information except for the current board 
			state). There is no way to change from&nbsp;'Play mode' to&nbsp;to Replay mode 
			(apart from saving a repay file). The difference between these two modes is 
			that in play mode new turns are expected from human and AI players, but in 
			replay mode you simply step forwards and backwards through a replay file. 
			Stepping backwards in play mode causes the currently turn to be 'destroyed' 
			effectively undoing the turn (which .
		</P>
		<h4>1. Screen</h4>
		This is where the game board and player pieces are displayed.&nbsp;You 
		can&nbsp;zoom and&nbsp;move around the board using the scroll bars. Also if the 
		user hovers over a grid square on the screen, they will get a small tooltip pop 
		up which will relate information about the location and contents of that 
		square. To make a move click your Snail pieces and drag it to an adjacent empty 
		square; if the move is to an adjacent Slime square, then your Snail will 
		automatically slide to the end of the Trail.
		<h4>2. Game Speed</h4>
		With this bar you can alter the speed at which AI players will take turns, 
		effectively slowing the game down so that you can see what is going on.
		<h4>3. Zoom Bar</h4>
		You can zoom into the board for a closer look if you need to by dragging the 
		slider on this bar.
		<h4>4. Game Controls</h4>
		These can be used to control the state of the game as well as skip ahead or 
		backwards. They are similar in play mode and replay mode:
		<p><IMG height="23" src="Button00.jpg" width="39"> <strong>Pass:</strong> Pass can 
			be used by a human player to skip his go. Play mode only.<br>
			<IMG height="23" src="Button01.jpg" width="23"> <strong>Play:</strong> Starts 
			the game or continues it if it is currently paused.<br>
			<IMG height="23" src="Button02.jpg" width="23"> <strong>Step back:</strong> This 
			can be used to step backwards one turn at a time. This control has slightly 
			different behaviour&nbsp;in play&nbsp;or replay mode. When a user is in play 
			mode clicking this button will destroy all information for the&nbsp;previous 
			turn (and step back). When the user is in replay mode this button will simply 
			take the user to the previous turn, and no turn information is lost.<br>
			<IMG height="23" src="Button03.jpg" width="23"> <strong>Pause:</strong> This 
			pauses the game (!).
			<br>
			<IMG height="23" src="Button04.jpg" width="23"> <strong>Step Forward:</strong> In 
			play mode, this causes the next AI player to take a turn. If the next player is 
			human then the button has no effect. In replay mode this can be used to step 
			forward to the next turn. When the last turn of the replay file is displayed 
			the turn box (5 above) will display "Game Over".<br>
			<IMG height="23" src="Button05.jpg" width="23"> <strong>Record:</strong> This 
			button does not do anything when you click on it, but it contains a context 
			menu which you can access by right clicking on the button. In play mode the 
			context menu has 2 options, 'Save as Terrain' and 'Save as Replay', in replay 
			mode there is only the 'Save as Terrain' option.<br>
			<IMG height="23" src="Button06.jpg" width="23"> <strong>Rewind:</strong> Rewind 
			is used in similar ways in both play mode and replay mode, it rewinds the game 
			to the first turn, but in the case of play mode it destroys all the turns that 
			have been made in this game, whereas in replay mode it simply puts the users at 
			turn 1 without destroying any turn information.
			<h4>5. Turn Counter</h4>
			This will simply display the current turn. If no player can move in the current 
			position (play mode) or the end of a replay file is reached (replay mode) it 
			displays "Game Over".
			<h4>6. Game Mode</h4>
			This simply displays the current game mode. In addition if you are in replay 
			mode you can right click on the red box and choose to enter play mode.
			<h4>7. Player List</h4>
		<P>This displays a scrollable list of all players in the current game and some 
			information about them. This information is their Player ID and name, what type 
			of player they are (Human or AI) and their current score.
			<br>
			If the user left-clicks on the player button with that players graphic on, they 
			will bring up that players trace (in the case of a human player there is no 
			trace information).
			<br>
			Right clicking on the button will bring up a menu which will alow users to load 
			either a user-created&nbsp;AI player, the default AI player or a human 
			controlled player. If a human player is loaded, users may right click on the 
			human players name and enter a new name for that player.
		</P>
		<h4>8. Trace Window and 9 Trace Window Player Indicator</h4>
		This window will display the trace ouput for the currently selected player. The 
		players icon will appear in the square marked with an 9 and his trace will 
		appear in the text window below. The text window is fully scrollable and it can 
		be docked and undocked from the main window of the form into its own separate 
		floating window by right clicking on the Trace/Chat tabs and selecting 
		Dock/Undock. Once the window is undocked it can be moved and resized to the 
		user's convienience. While undocked the window is redocked by closing it.
		<h3>10. Terrain Editor</h3>
		<IMG height="512" src="TerrainEditor.bmp" width="280"><br>
		Entering this tab for the first time will reveal a series of disabled buttons 
		and controls. These controls, once activated (by pressing the "Enable Terrain 
		Editing" button)&nbsp;can be used to modify the board and pieces on the board. 
		Most of the controls are fairly self-explanatory - they are briefly described 
		below. Once you have finished changing the values of the controls, hit the 
		button labeled 'Update Terrain Values' and the new board will appear on screen 
		with no player pieces on.
		<BR>
		<P><strong>a. </strong>To enter terrain editing mode you must click on this button. 
			Be very careful when you do this, as clicking this button will cause all the 
			previous turn information to be deleted for the current game, although the 
			current board position is retained.<BR>
			<strong>b. </strong>From this drop down menu you can select a set of default 
			values for the board such as width and height, they can either be for&nbsp;the 
			current board or the default board or (if you have alter any of the values in 
			the controls) you can use custom terrain values. When you select an option from 
			the drop down, fills in values for the controls in the terrain editor.<BR>
			<strong>c. </strong>This is where you can give your map a name. It will appear 
			in the title bar when you load it in.<BR>
			<strong>d. </strong>This control lets you set the number of player that are 
			allowed on a board.<BR>
			<strong>e. </strong>This sets the width of the board in grid squares. The 
			current maximum is 200.<BR>
			<strong>f. </strong>This sets the height of the board in grid squares. The 
			current maximum is 200.<BR>
			<strong>g. </strong>This sets the width of an individual gridsquare in pixels. 
			The current maximum is 200.<BR>
			<strong>h. </strong>This sets the height of an individual gridsquare in pixels. 
			The current maximum is 200.
			<BR>
			If a very large grid size and a large grid square size is chosen, you will be 
			warned of the possibility of a system slowdown or crash - but all reasonable 
			sizes, up to around 200x200 with 20x20 pixel squares, should work on a powerful 
			PC.<BR>
			<strong>i. </strong>The grid lines separate all the squares so that individual 
			grid squares can be seen, this controls sets the thickness of those lines. If a 
			thickness of zero is chosen then the gridlines will not be displayed.<BR>
			<strong>j. </strong>This sets the colour for the grid lines. Just hit browse 
			and a colour picker will appear, select the colour from that.<BR>
			<strong>k. </strong>This control allows the user to select a directory where 
			the user has created custom graphics. Once the path is set from the browse 
			button, the new graphics will be loaded into the game. Custom graphics must 
			have exactly the correct names. For Infectious! these are: 1ActiveColony.bmp, 
			1PassiveColony.bmp, 2ActiveColony.bmp, 2PassiveColony.bmp, ...&nbsp;for player 
			pieces; Impassable.bmp for impassable squares; and Background.bmp for the large 
			background image.<BR>
			<strong>l. </strong>This is the update terrain values button, once you press 
			this a new empty board will be created and all player pieces that are on the 
			current board will be discarded.<BR>
			<strong>m. </strong>This button allows the user to save any 
			graphics&nbsp;currently loaded for player or terrain pieces. This directory 
			will become the graphics path for this terrain.<br>
			<strong>n. </strong>This control allows the user to save this terrain file as 
			usual.<br>
			<strong>o. </strong>These are the Terrain and Player piece buttons. When a user 
			clicks on these buttons, his cursor will change to reflect the piece he has 
			picked up. Now when he/she clicks on a grid square the player piece will be 
			placed in that grid square. There is a tooltip for each button, to let the user 
			know what each button is for (this can be viewed by hovering the mouse over the 
			button for a few seconds. To erase the contents of a grid square and set it to 
			Empty, use the Empty grid square button (this is marked with a red circle with 
			a line through it). Right click on a terrain piece to get a context menu which 
			allows the graphics sprite to be changed or reset.<BR>

		<h4>
			How to use the Terrain Editor</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
			The terrain editor is very simple to use. After enabling controls you can 
			change the size and shape of the board and some of its other parameters like 
			the name of your terrain or the number of players.
			<li>
			Once you have done this, click on update terrain. When you do this, all the 
			currently player pieces will disappear from the board and your new board will 
			appear, without any player pieces on it.
			<li>
			Now you can load in new graphics for each player by right clicking on the 
			buttons underneath and selecting 'Load newSprite'
			<li>
			When you have created a satisfactory new board, you can begin to add new player 
			pieces to it. You can do this by clicking on a Player Piece Button in the 
			terrain editor, this will cause your cursor to change to resemble the piece you 
			have picked up. Now you can click on any gridsquare on the board and add the 
			player piece to that square.
			<li>
				Once you have done this, you can save the terrain and/or simply return to 
				Play/Replay tab and start playing a game normaly.</li>
